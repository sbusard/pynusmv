PyNuSMV is a Python binding for NuSMV. It is intended to provide a Python
interface to NuSMV, allowing to use NuSMV as a library.

More details about this tool are provided in the PyNuSMV documentation
(see the DOCUMENTATION section below).


-----
BUILD
-----

Dependencies
------------

NuSMV is needed to compile and use PyNuSMV. To compile NuSMV, you need

* An ANSI C compiler (gcc will do, as will several versions of cc)
* GNU Flex version 2.5 or greater
* GNU Bison version 1.22 or greater
* GNU make utility version 3.74 or greater
* GNU tar and gzip utilities.

More information about NuSMV compilation can be found in src/nusmv/README.


In addition to tools needed by NuSMV to compile and run, PyNuSMV needs the
following tools:

* Python version 3.2 or higher -- http://python.org/
* Setuptools 2.1 or higher -- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
* SWIG version 2.0.6 or higher -- http://www.swig.org/
* pyparsing version 2.0.2 or higher -- http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/

SWIG and pyparsing are provided in this package in the dep/ directory.


Warning: PyNuSMV does NOT work with Python 2.


Build
-----

With the pre-compiled version of PyNuSMV, PyNuSMV is already built and is
located in src/pynumsv. Otherwise, read the following instructions.


To build PyNuSMV, you can just use the provided Makefiles:

make

These Makefiles accept arguments:
    - PYTHON defines the Python command. By default, `python3` is used.
    - SWIG defines the SWIG command. By default, if `swig` exists, it is used,
      otherwise, SWIG is compiled with the sources given in the dep/ directory;
      if this argument is not empty, it is used as the `swig` command.
    - PYPARSING defines the pyparsing file. By default, pyparsing is searched,
      if found it is used, otherwise it is extracted from the sources given in
      the dep/ directory; if PYPARSING is set to something different from 0,
      the file is taken from the sources even if pyparsing is already
      installed.

For example, if you want to use `python3.2` instead of `python3` and to compile
SWIG from sources even if it is already installed, you can use:

make PYTHON=python3.2 SWIG=


PyNuSMV is then located into src/pynusmv directory.

To check if the compilation was successfull, you can run the unit tests:
    cd src/
    python3 -m unittest

If you want more control on the different steps of the building, you can follow
these instructions:

First compile NuSMV:

# Compile CUDD
cd src/cudd-2.4.1.1
make # use platform-specific makefile if needed e.g. make -f Makefile_os_x_64bit

# Compile NuSMV
cd ../nusmv
./configure CFLAGS="-g -O2 -fPIC"
make
cd ..

Then, you can build PyNuSMV by running:
./build_libnusmv.sh
python setup.py build_ext --inplace


Problems
--------

On Mac OS X, an error can occur when compiling NuSMV sources when embedding no
SAT solver:

/bin/sh ../../../libtool --tag=CC   --mode=link gcc -std=gnu99  -fno-strict-aliasing -g -O2   -o libsatsolvers.la -lm 
libtool: link: ar cru .libs/libsatsolvers.a 
ar: no archive members specified
usage:  ar -d [-TLsv] archive file ...
    ar -m [-TLsv] archive file ...
    ar -m [-abiTLsv] position archive file ...
    ar -p [-TLsv] archive [file ...]
    ar -q [-cTLsv] archive file ...
    ar -r [-cuTLsv] archive file ...
    ar -r [-abciuTLsv] position archive file ...
    ar -t [-TLsv] archive [file ...]
    ar -x [-ouTLsv] archive [file ...]


To avoid this error, modify
    src/nusmv/src/sat/Makefile:
        line 85: libsat_la_DEPENDENCIES = 
        line 343: libsat_la_LIBADD = 
    src/nusmv/src/sat/solvers/Makefile:
        line 322: noinst_LTLIBRARIES =

You can also apply the patch 'macos.patch':
    patch -p0 < macos.patch     

You might encounter a failure when compiling SWIG as PCRE libraries might
not be installed. To install, you can use brew:
    brew install pcre

Using PyNuSMV
-------------

When PyNuSMV is built (with a pre-compiled version, or by following the
instructions above), you can use it by going into the src/ directory, running a
Python session and importing the pynusmv module.

If you to be able to access to PyNuSMV from anywhere, you have to set two
different environment variables:

    - LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH under Mac OS) must contain the path
      to the src/lib/ directory of PyNuSMV package.
    - PYTHONPATH must contain the path to the src/ directory of PyNuSMV
      package.

With these two environment variables set (and exported), you can import the
pynusmv module, from any Python program or session, from anywhere on your
computer (instead of just from the src/ directory).

Finally, you can also update the pynusmv.sh script in the PyNuSMV package to
add the path to PyNuSMV package and then you can start a Python session with
pynusmv already loaded with:

./pynusmv.sh


-------------
DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The full API of (the upper interface of) PyNuSMV can be generated thanks
to Sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) by running:

make html

in the doc/ directory. The documentation is then available in the
doc/html/index.html page. Other userful information like a presentation
of the tool and a short tutorial are also given.

The same documentation is also available on http://pynusmv.readthedocs.org/.
